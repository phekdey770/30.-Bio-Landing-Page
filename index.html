        <h2>Cambodia</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Sinn Sisamouth</b> (c. 1932 – c. 1976) was a Cambodian singer-songwriter
          active from the 1950s to the 1970s. Widely considered the "King of Khmer Music",
          Sisamouth, along with Ros Serey Sothea, Pen Ran, Mao Sareth, and other
          Cambodian artists, was part of a thriving pop music scene in Phnom Penh
          that blended elements of Khmer traditional music with the sounds of
          rhythm and blues and rock and roll to develop a Cambodian rock sound.
          Sisamouth died during the Khmer Rouge regime under circumstances that
          are unclear.

        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Sinn Sisamouth was born in Stung Treng Province, the son of Sinn Leang and mother Seb Bunlei.
            One or both of Sisamouth's parents were partially Lao. Most sources list his year of birth as
            1935, though some list 1932 or 1933. 23 August 1933 is generally accepted as his date of birth.
            Some people that had been alive during Sisamouth's era state that he was born during the
            Rooster zodiac, which includes the year 1933. Sisamouth's father was a soldier during the
            Colonial Cambodia period and also served as prison warden in Battambang Province. His father
            died when he was a child and his mother then remarried.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sisamouth learned to play stringed instruments at the age of six or seven, and showed a natural
            singing talent. He was often invited to perform music at school functions. At about age 16 he
            graduated from primary school and moved to Phnom Penh to study medicine; this plan was apparently
            meant to please his parents when his true goal was to become a musician. He began composing his
            own songs around this time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sisamouth graduated from medical school around the time that Cambodia gained independence from
            France in 1953. He initially worked in a Phnom Penh hospital as a nurse, but was soon hired by
            the Cambodian national radio station as a singer with its band. Around this time, Sisamouth
            married his cousin Keo Thorng Gnu in an arranged marriage, and they eventually had four children.
          </li>
          <li>
            While performing with the Cambodian national radio station, Sisamouth became a protege of Queen
            Sisowath Kossamak, mother of Head of State Norodom Sihanouk. The Queen invited Sisamouth to join
            the Vong Phleng Preah Reach Troap (the classical ensemble of the Royal Treasury) with which he
            performed at royal receptions and state functions. He also achieved hit songs on national radio
            around this time, first writing and performing songs based on traditional Khmer music. In the
            mid-1950s, the romantic ballad "Violon Sneha", composed by violinist Hass Salan, catapulted
            Sisamouth into stardom across Cambodia.

            Sisamouth became known for his crooning voice, which has been likened to that of Nat King Cole,
            while his stage presence has been compared to that of Frank Sinatra. By the late 1950s,
            Sisamouth had established himself as the leading figure in an expanding Cambodian pop music scene.
            Norodom Sihanouk, a musician himself, encouraged the development of popular music in Cambodia.
            Initially, pop records from France and Latin America were imported into the country and became
            popular, inspiring a flourishing music scene based in Phnom Penh.
